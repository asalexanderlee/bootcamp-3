## RESTful Design and APIs

## Pre-reading

* [Restful Design Architecture](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming)
* [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
* [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
* [What is an API?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82)

## Questions

* What's the difference between GET, POST, PUT, DELETE? When do you use each?
* How do CRUD and REST relate?
* Why is JSON represented as a string?
* Why do you think we are using JSON instead of XML?

# Challenge

Today we are going to create an API for a todo list application. That is, we are creating a server that sends and receives HTTP requests. Instead of using a browser, we'll be using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to send and receive JSON web requests.

## Release 0

[Here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) is a list of a number of free APIs. Sign up for one and use Postman to query it. 

## Release 1

Using RESTful design architecture, sketch out the RESTful routes and CRUD operations needed to perform the following operations in our todo app:

* get all todos.
* get a single todo by an id.
* get all completed todos.
* get all uncompleted todos.
* add a new todo.
* delete a todo by id.
* mark a todo as complete by id.
* update the text of a todo by id.

## Release 2

In `server.js` implement the following:

* A Mongoose schema for a Todo model.
* All of the routes you defined in _Release 1_.
* Use Postman to test your server.

To start the server, type: `npm run dev`.
Once completed with Release 2 you should have a fully functional todo list API. Woohoo!

## Release 3 

Right now, everything is one file right now, `server.js`. Seperate your models and routes out into their own files folders. Use  [Express](https://github.com/DavidsonCollege/expresso) as a model of best practice.
